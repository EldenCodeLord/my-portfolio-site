      <h3><em>About Me:</em></h3>
      <p class="important">Hello! My name is Manuel. I have been a welder for approximately 6 years.
       I began my journey at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> last week!
       Been working hard as welder and came to the realization that I wanted something 
       more in life. Don't get me wrong, I love <span class="highlight">welding. 
       It's just time for a change and start a new career. Welcome to my life.</span>
